# Aperture - A Dynamic Frontend Showcase

Welcome to the repository for **Aperture**, a visually stunning and highly interactive single-page website for a conceptual creative studio. This project serves as a comprehensive demonstration of modern frontend development techniques, focusing on creating a breathtaking user experience through advanced animations, 3D graphics, and sophisticated scroll-based storytelling.

Every section of this website is a faithful replication of high-end design assets, synthesized into a single, cohesive, and fully functional showcase.

## ‚≠ê A Note on AI-Assisted Creation

This entire project, from the initial HTML structure to the complex JavaScript animations and WebGL effects, was generated by a large language model from Google through Google AI Studio.

The development process was a collaboration:
-   **Human Direction:** The vision, design assets, reference videos, and iterative feedback were provided by the user.
-   **AI Execution:** The AI translated these visual concepts and high-level requirements into functional, production-quality code.

This repository stands as a testament to the power of human-AI collaboration in modern web development, demonstrating the ability to rapidly prototype and build sophisticated digital experiences based on clear, creative direction.

## ‚ú® Features

This website is packed with cutting-edge features, each meticulously crafted to provide a premium user experience:

-   **High-Fidelity Fluid Cursor:** A real-time, iridescent fluid simulation that follows the user's cursor across the entire site, created with a stable Canvas 2D particle system.
-   **Complex Loader Animation:** A precise replication of the multi-stage loader animation, built with GSAP for smooth, reliable performance.
-   **Parallax Hero Section:** A Fathom-style landing page where UI cards float in a 3D space and part elegantly on scroll.
-   **Interactive 3D Grid:** A real-time 3D scene built with **Three.js**, featuring a grid of objects that dynamically react to the user's mouse position with a physics-based repulsion effect.
-   **Vertical-to-Horizontal Scroll:** A sophisticated scroll-hijacking implementation where the user's vertical scroll drives a horizontal journey through a portfolio of projects.
-   **Diagonal Wipe Transitions:** The transition between portfolio projects features a sharp, dynamic diagonal wipe effect synchronized with the scroll.
-   **Luxury Product Hover Effect:** Portfolio items feature an elegant static-image-to-video transition on hover.
-   **3D Floating Testimonials:** A constellation of testimonial cards that float and drift in a 3D perspective space, reacting to mouse movement with a subtle parallax effect.
-   **Advanced Tab Component:** A "Capabilities" section with a sliding indicator and smooth slide-in/out transitions for content panes.
-   **Light & Dark Mode:** A fully implemented, theme-aware design that respects user preferences and provides a beautiful experience in both light and dark modes.
-   **Fully Responsive Design:** A mobile-first layout that ensures perfect usability on all devices, with complex animations progressively enhanced for desktop users to guarantee optimal performance.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

This project leverages a modern, dependency-light stack focused on the core languages of the web, enhanced by industry-standard animation libraries.

-   **HTML5:** Semantic HTML for a clean and accessible structure.
-   **CSS3:** Advanced CSS for styling, layout (Flexbox, Grid), and custom properties for theming.
-   **JavaScript (ES6 Modules):** The core logic for all interactivity and animations.
-   **GSAP (GreenSock Animation Platform):** The industry-leading library for high-performance web animations, used for the loader, parallax effects, and all scroll-triggered events.
-   **Three.js:** A powerful 3D graphics library used to create the "Interact with the Abstract" scene.
-   **No Frameworks:** This project is built with "vanilla" technologies to demonstrate proficiency with the fundamentals of the web platform.

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

This project uses JavaScript modules (`type="module"`) for its 3D components. For security reasons, modern browsers block these modules from running when a file is opened directly from the local filesystem (i.e., via the `file://` protocol).

**You must serve the files using a local web server.** The easiest way is with the **Live Server** extension in Visual Studio Code.

### Instructions

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/MisterStranger03/Unstop-FrontEnd-Competetion.git
    cd Unstop-FrontEnd-Competetion
    ```

2.  **Open in VS Code:**
    Open the project folder in Visual Studio Code.

3.  **Install Live Server Extension:**
    -   Go to the Extensions view (`Ctrl+Shift+X` or `Cmd+Shift+X`).
    -   Search for `Live Server` by Ritwick Dey.
    -   Click **Install**.

4.  **Go Live:**
    -   Right-click the `index.html` file in the VS Code explorer.
    -   Select **"Open with Live Server"**.

    A new browser tab will automatically open at an address like `http://127.0.0.1:5500`, and the website will be fully functional.
